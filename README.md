# LI-FI

LiFi, or Light Fidelity, is a wireless communication technology that uses light to transmit data. It is similar to WiFi in that it enables high-speed communication between devices, but instead of using radio waves, LiFi uses visible light, ultraviolet, or infrared light for data transmission. This technology utilizes light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to modulate light signals at very high speeds, which can then be received by photodetectors. LiFi offers several potential advantages over WiFi, including potentially higher data transfer speeds, increased security (since light cannot penetrate walls like radio waves), and the avoidance of electromagnetic interference. However, its practical applications are still being explored and developed.

### Components
**LED (Light-Emitting Diode):** A semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current passes through it. LEDs are commonly used for illumination, indicators, and in this case, potentially for LiFi communication.

**Aux cable (3.5 mm jack):** A cable with a 3.5 mm audio jack on both ends, typically used to connect audio devices such as smartphones, MP3 players, or computers to speakers, headphones, or other audio equipment.

**Speaker:** An electromechanical device that converts electrical signals into sound waves. Speakers are used to output audio from electronic devices.

**Resistor (100 ohms):** A passive two-terminal electrical component that resists the flow of electric current. The resistor you specified has a resistance of 100 ohms, which can be used to limit current in an electrical circuit or adjust signal levels.

**Wires: **Conductive materials typically made of copper or aluminum that are used to connect electrical components within a circuit.

**Solar panel:** A device that converts sunlight into electrical energy through the photovoltaic effect. Solar panels are often used to generate electricity for various applications, including powering electronic devices or charging batteries.

**Mobile phone/Alexa:** Electronic devices that can process data, connect to the internet, and perform various tasks such as making calls, playing music, or controlling smart home devices. In the context of your list, these devices could potentially be used as sources of audio signals or data for communication projects.
